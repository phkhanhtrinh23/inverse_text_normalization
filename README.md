# Inverse Text Normalization


## About The Project

My project is called **Inverse Text Normalization**. This project is based on [Neural Models of Text Normalization for Speech Applications](https://aclanthology.org/J19-2004.pdf). However, I applied it to the **Inverse** Text Normalization downstream task. Furthermore, I improved the results by utilizing the [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) mechanism. Specifically, I used the [bert2BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07143) architecture.


## Getting Started

To get started, you should have prior knowledge on **Python** and **Pytorch** at first. A few resources to get you started if this is your first Python or Tensorflow project:

- [Pytorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
- [Python for Beginners](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)


## Installation and Run

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/phkhanhtrinh23/inverse_text_normalization.git
   ```
  
2. Use any code editor to open the folder **inverse_text_normalization**.


## Step-by-step

1. The dataset is: [spoken_norm_assignment](https://huggingface.co/datasets/VietAI/spoken_norm_assignment) from a VietAI's course that I studied.

2. Read and run `main.py` to train the bert2BERT model.
